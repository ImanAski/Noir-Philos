The philosophy of black itself is absorbing. Now when we are talking about a black wisdom we are 
technically talking about a wisdom that wants to absorb anything else.

## What Am I seeing?

This project is about creating and staying. We are aiming at creating a rust-powered performance

> We Live In Strange Times (It's Not My Fault)

As my beloved musician Thom Yorke once said.
We are living in a world where everyone wants to play a part in it. Doesn't matter if it's about money, history or
